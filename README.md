# Newgistics::Api

A Ruby 2 client for the Newgistics API, free from dependencies.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'newgistics-api'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install newgistics-api

## Usage

1. Initialize the GEM:
```ruby
NewgisticsApi.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = api_credentials["api_key"]
  config.host = api_credentials["host"]
end
```

2. Run a request
Each of the method arguments are passes as keyword arguments. You can find the supported methods in lib/newgistics_api.

For example, the tracking API takes 3 parameters: `def track_shipment(merchant_id: nil, qualifier: nil, search_strings: [])`:
```ruby
response = NewgisticsApi::Tracking.new.track_shipment(merchant_id: "123", qualifier: "Barcode", search_strings: [721234567890])
```

3. Manipulate the response
```ruby
response.success?

response.body # raw JSON body
response.parsed_body # JSON parsed body
response.decorated_response # decorated response if the class has a decorator
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

If you need to re-run VCR cassettes, `cp spec/api_credentials.yml.sample spec/api_credentials.yml` and update the file with your credentials. VCR is configured to anonymize the API_KEY and the HOST for you.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
